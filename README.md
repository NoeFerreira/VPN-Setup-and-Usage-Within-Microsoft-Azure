<h1>Azure VM Creation and VPN Testing Lab</h1>
This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a Virtual Machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure, accessing it via Remote Desktop, configuring ProtonVPN, and exploring how VPN usage impacts your IP address and browsing experience. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- ProtonVPN
- Web Browsing

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 Pro (22H2 - x64 Gen2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Create and Configure the Azure VM
- Record IP Address from the Azure VM
- Sign Up for ProtonVPN
- Install ProtonVPN in the Virtual Machine
- Record IP Address from the VPN Connection
- Browse Websites and Test VPN Effects

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
  
## Step 1: Create and Configure the Azure VM

</p>
<p>
  
-  Log in to the Microsoft Azure Portal.
- Navigate to Virtual Machines and click Create to set up a new VM.
- Select the following configurations for your VM:
  - Name: **Windows10VM**
  - vCPUs: **2**
  - Username: **LabUser**
  - Password: **cyberlab123!**
  - Logged into the VM using Remote Desktop. Public IP address
- After creation, click on the VM and locate its Public IP Address.
- Use Remote Desktop to connect to the VM
</p>
<br />

## Step 2: Record IP Address from the Azure VM

<p>
  
- Logged into the Azure VM using Remote Desktop.
- Opened a browser inside the VM and visited
     - [What is My IP Address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/).
- Recorded the IP address associated with the VM.

</p>
<br />

## Step 3: Sign Up for ProtonVPN

</p>
<p>
  
- Navigate to ProtonVPN Sign-Up and sign up for a free account.
   - [ProtonVPN Sign-Up](https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free&language=en).

- Follow the instructions to confirm your email address and activate your ProtonVPN account. 


</p>
<br />

## Step 4: Install ProtonVPN in the Virtual Machine

</p>
<p>
  
- Download the ProtonVPN client from the official website.
- Open the downloaded installer and follow the steps to install ProtonVPN in your Azure VM.
- After installation, launch ProtonVPN and log in using your credentials from **Step 3**
</p>
<br />

## Step 5: Press "Connect" To Enable VPN

</p>
<p> 
  
- Connect to a VPN server located in a different country (e.g., Japan).
- Observe the new IP address assigned by ProtonVPN. 

</p>
<br />

## Step 6: Record IP Address from the VPN Connection

</p>
<p>
  
- Once connected, [What is My IP Address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) again to observe the new IP address.
- Record the new IP address assigned by ProtonVPN.

</p>
<br />

## Step 7: Browse Websites and Test VPN Effects

</p>

- With the VPN connection active, browse the following websites inside the Azure VM:
  - [Google](https://www.google.com)
  - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)
  - [Disney](https://www.disney.com)
- Observe any changes in website content based on the VPN location. For example:
   - Language preferences might change.
   - Region-specific content or offers might be displayed (e.g., products available only in certain countries).

</p>
<br />

## Conclusion

In summary, deploying a Virtual Machine in Azure and using ProtonVPN to modify your IP address illustrates how geographic location can influence internet browsing. Through this lab, youâ€™ve gained practical experience in using VPNs to observe regional website variations, deepening your understanding of cloud computing, VPN functionality, and online privacy.
